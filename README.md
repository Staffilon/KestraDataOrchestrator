## Project Outline

The project was an explorative research on a dataset provided by Tormatic Srl. It consisted on several steps:

- We performed feature engineering and explorative data analysis on the initial dataframes, realizing different graphs and solution by leveraging on the power of Python and its libraries like: matplotlib and Pandas.

- We studied if we could work with the data to create a smart machine learning model to perform predictive maintenance.
- We prototyped an ideal data pipeline that could work to solve the company needs. This was done by using many different technologies: AWS, MongoDB, PySpark, Kestra and PowerBI.
