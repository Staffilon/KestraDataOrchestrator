## Project Outline

The project aims to experiment real-time data analysis techniques using data analytics frameworks. The prototype input will be the data generated by the  IoT simulator shown during the course. The project aims to  investigate the application of a data orchestrator like Kestra (https://kestra.io/) in order to connect the IoT simulator and the Analytic Framework. The results can be saved to a NoSQL database of your choice.

Project prototype should cover the following topics:

-Connect the IoT simulator

-Perform statistics connecting the Data Analytic Framework

-Publish the data on some NoSQL database (e.g. ElasticSearch, Mongo, etc.)
