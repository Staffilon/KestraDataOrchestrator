## Project Outline

Our exploration centered on a dataset provided by Tormatic SRL. The investigation unfolded in several phases:

- Initially, we engaged in feature engineering and exploratory data analysis using the raw datasets. Our tools of choice were Python and its powerful libraries such as matplotlib and pandas, which enabled us to craft various graphs and analytical solutions.

- Our research also probed the feasibility of employing the data in developing an intelligent machine learning model dedicated to predictive maintenance.
- We designed a conceptual data pipeline tailored to meet the company's specific requirements. This endeavor employed a diverse suite of technologies, including AWS, MongoDB, PySpark, Kestra, and PowerBI.We prototyped an ideal data pipeline that could work to solve the company needs. This was done by using many different technologies: AWS, MongoDB, PySpark, Kestra and PowerBI.
